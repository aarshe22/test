This is document 1 for testing the document selection feature.

The document selection system allows users to:
- Select individual documents using checkboxes
- Use a "Select All" checkbox to toggle all documents
- See which documents are selected for processing
- Load only the selected documents into memory

This helps with memory management by allowing users to process only the documents they need.
