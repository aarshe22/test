This is a sample document for testing the data folder functionality.

The Mistral 7B model is a powerful language model that can process and understand various types of documents including:
- PDF files
- Word documents (DOC, DOCX)
- CSV spreadsheets
- Plain text files

This feature allows users to either upload documents manually or use documents that are pre-placed in the ./data folder, which gets mounted into the container at /data.

The system will automatically scan the data folder for supported document types and extract text from them for use in conversations with the AI assistant.
